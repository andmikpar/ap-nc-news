## Setup

In order to run the project locally, you will need to create two .env files, one named .env.test, and the other named .env.development.

In each of these, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here> (as seen in the .env_example) and insert the correct database name for each environment (you can find the database names in /db/setup.sql). Don't forget to check these .env files are included in the .gitignore file.
