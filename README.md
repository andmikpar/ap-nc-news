# Northcoders News API

## Setup

In order to run the project locally, you will need to create two .env files, one named .env.test which contains PGDATABASE=nc_news_test, and the other named .env.development, containing PGDATABASE=nc_news.

Don't forget to check these .env files are included in the .gitignore file.
